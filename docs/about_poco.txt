SHORT DESCRIPTION
    poco is a PowerShell port of peco (https://github.com/peco/peco) and
    offers in-pipeline, interactive filtering of objects or text.

LONG DESCRIPTION
    
    Select-Poco will collect all pipeline input and display a blocking,
    interactive UI.

    Queries
        The format for queries is simplistic but does support most of the
        basic comparison operators.

        The query line accepts a list of space separated patterns and
        commands.  Each pattern is boolean AND joined to all other patterns
        entered.  All patterns will use the same matching modes.

        Pattern modes are "regex", "like" or "eq".  Additionally there is
        case sensitive mode and inverted mode ("not").  Modes are switched by
        their corresponding key binding or by parameters on Select-Poco.

        Commands between with ":" and change the following patterns to match
        against the object property that matches the name in the command until
        another command is entered.  For example, ":name foo" will match "foo"
        against the values in the "Name" property of all input objects.
